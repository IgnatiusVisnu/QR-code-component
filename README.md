## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS



### What I learned

```css
.white {
    background-color: white;
    width: 25%;
    height: auto;
    margin: 5% auto 5% auto;
    padding: 2% 0 2% 0;
    border-radius: 30px;
    text-align: center;
   
    
}

Not sure if I'm proud of this, but I tried to mitigate my lack of control with the spaces between the QR and the remainder unfilled gap of the white square using paddings that I estimated to make it look more uniform and similar in length


### Continued development

I want to develop myself more in terms of positioning skills so I can recreate a template of website with frontend knowledge with better efficiency and more practical.
